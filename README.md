# Heart Disease Prediction 

# Why Heart Disease ?
 - Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States.
 - About 659,000 people in the United States die from heart disease each year—that’s 1 in every 4 deaths.
 
 The prevalence of heart disease is a major health issue in the United States.  Its prevalence means there is a breath of useful data
 available.  This is due to the many health organizations seeking to limit its effects on our nation's population.  The target is pretty straight forward.
 What are the features that can accurately predict heart disease?  Our team believes this is both a practical use of machine learning models 
 as well as a symbolically noble topic to investigate due to the benefits such research can potentially have on our society.
